Aesthetics and Computation final project repository for group 2

The concept of our project revolves around how someone centering themselves may aid them both literally and figuratively. How our project will work is that when a user’s face is detected then a rectangle overlays it. We decided we wanted to sonify the position of the rectangle on screen (AKA the position and movement of the user’s face). If their face is centered on the screen, then the sound will be a soft, low tone. As their face gets closer to the edges of the screen, then the sound becomes higher, as if in warning (and in urge of the user to return to the center). 

We think this is a pertinent tool for the moment of the times we are in. Amidst the pandemic, education and work must primarily be achieved remotely. More so than ever, computers and video-conferencing platforms are crucial, for they are sources of human connection. Anyone, anywhere, at any time is now accessible. The one requirement is yourself within frame of a webcam. Although it sounds simple, centering yourself on screen can be a cumbersome task. When struggling to learn and develop skills and knowledge, sometimes you inadvertently dip out of screen where people can’t see you, which is obstructive to communication. Our project serves as a tool in never needing to check whether you’re centered on screen – you simply know by sound.

Furthermore, we believe physically centering yourself on screen may translate to feeling mentally oriented and we thought about how we could further turn the digital space into a peaceful space. When the user needs a break from the stresses of their screen, they may enter our project’s mediation mode (by pressing a button. Right now press b on your keyboard to view). A web of shapes fills the screen, and the user is supposed to inhale and exhale in coordination with its movement. The user’s face position will still be sonified in the same fashion, for one should remain centered when meditating.
